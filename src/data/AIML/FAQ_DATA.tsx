    question: "How much data do I need to build a custom AI model?",
    answer: "The data requirements vary significantly based on the problem complexity. For simple classification tasks, you might achieve good results with 1,000-10,000 labeled examples. Computer vision applications typically require 10,000-100,000 images. However, we can often leverage transfer learning and pre-trained models to achieve excellent results with smaller datasets. During our discovery phase, we’ll assess your data availability and recommend the best approach.",
  },
  {
    question: "How long does it take to develop and deploy an AI solution?",
    answer: "Timelines depend on project scope and complexity. A simple predictive model might be deployed in 6-8 weeks, while complex computer vision systems can take 4-6 months. Our typical project timeline is 3-5 months from kickoff to production deployment. We follow an agile approach with regular milestones and demonstrations.",
  },
  {
    question: "What ROI can I expect from AI implementation?",
    answer: "ROI varies by use case, but our clients typically see returns within 6-18 months. Common benefits include: 20-40% cost reduction in automated processes, 15-30% improvement in prediction accuracy, 50-75% reduction in processing time, and 10-25% revenue increase through optimization. We develop detailed ROI models during the strategy phase.",
  },
  {
    question: "How do you ensure AI models remain accurate over time?",
    answer: "We implement comprehensive MLOps practices including continuous monitoring, automated drift detection, and scheduled retraining. Our monitoring systems track model performance metrics in real time and alert when degradation occurs. We typically retrain models quarterly or when performance drops below thresholds.",
  },
  {
    question: "Can AI models explain their decisions?",
    answer: "Yes, we prioritize interpretability and explainability. For regulated industries, we use inherently interpretable models or apply techniques like SHAP values, LIME, or attention visualization to explain predictions. Our model documentation includes feature importance analysis and decision logic explanations.",
  },
  {
    question: "How do you address bias and fairness in AI models?",
    answer: "We conduct systematic bias testing across protected attributes (race, gender, age, etc.). Our process includes diverse training data collection, bias detection during development, fairness metrics evaluation, and ongoing monitoring in production. We can also implement bias mitigation techniques like reweighting or adversarial debiasing.",
  },
  {
    question: "What about data privacy and security?",
    answer: "We follow industry best practices for data security including encryption at rest and in transit, access controls, audit logging, and compliance with regulations (GDPR, HIPAA, etc.). Data can be processed on premise or in secure cloud native environments. We sign comprehensive NDAs and can accommodate specific security requirements.",
  },
  {
    question: "Do I need to have data science expertise in house?",
    answer: "No, we provide end to end AI development including strategy, implementation, and deployment. We do recommend having someone on your team who can work with our data scientists, typically a business analyst or product manager who understands your domain. We also provide knowledge transfer and can train your team.",
  },
  {
    question: "Can AI solutions integrate with our existing systems?",
    answer: "Yes, we specialize in integrating AI capabilities with existing enterprise systems including ERP, CRM, databases, and custom applications. We use standard APIs, microservices architecture, and can accommodate various integration patterns (REST, GraphQL, message queues, direct database access).",
  },
  {
    question: "What if the AI model doesn’t perform well enough?",
    answer: "We set clear success metrics upfront and work iteratively to achieve them. If initial models don’t meet targets, we explore data quality improvement, feature engineering, alternative algorithms, or ensemble methods. We don’t consider projects complete until performance meets agreed-upon thresholds.",
  },
  {
    question: "How much does AI development cost?",
    answer: "Investment varies based on project scope. Small proof-of-concept projects start around $25,000-50,000. Production-grade solutions typically range from $100,000-500,000. Enterprise-scale implementations can exceed $1M. We provide detailed estimates after initial discovery and scoping.",
  },
  {
    question: "Can you start with a pilot project before full implementation?",
    answer: "Absolutely. We recommend starting with a focused pilot to prove value before scaling. Typical pilots last 8-12 weeks, demonstrate capabilities on a subset of data, and provide clear success metrics that inform the decision to scale.",
