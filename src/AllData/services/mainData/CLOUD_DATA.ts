        question: "How long does cloud migration take?",

      },
      {
        question: "Will migration cause downtime?",
        answer: "Most migrations are executed with zero or minimal downtime using strategies like blue-green deployment. Critical applications typically experience less than 4 hours of downtime during the final cutover."
      },
      {
        question: "How much will cloud migration cost?",
        answer: "Migration costs typically range from 10-20% of annual infrastructure spend. However, post-migration savings usually recover this investment within 12-18 months."
      },
      {
        question: "Is cloud more secure than on-premise?",
        answer: "Yes, provided it is configured correctly. Cloud platforms offer enterprise-grade security tools. We implement comprehensive security controls and Shared Responsibility Models to ensure high security."
      },
      {
        question: "Can we migrate back to on-premise if needed?",
        answer: "Yes, though it is rare. We design architectures to avoid vendor lock-in where possible, but reversing a migration can be complex depending on the cloud-native services used."
